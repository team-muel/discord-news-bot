# Sprint Pipeline Routing

## Goal

Route tasks through sprint phases with deterministic flow and clear safety gates.

## Default Sprint Flow

```
/plan → /implement → /review → /qa → /ops-validate → /ship → /retro
```

## Conditional Phase Insertions

- `/security-audit`: inserted between `/review` and `/qa` when high-risk content is detected
- Implement↔review loop: up to `SPRINT_MAX_IMPL_REVIEW_LOOPS` (default 3) iterations when review finds critical issues

## Phase → Lead Agent Mapping

| Phase             | Lead Agent | Runtime Action     |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| `/plan`           | OpenDev    | `opendev.plan`     |
| `/implement`      | OpenCode   | `opencode.execute` |
| `/review`         | NemoClaw   | `nemoclaw.review`  |
| `/qa`             | OpenCode   | `qa.test`          |
| `/security-audit` | NemoClaw   | `cso.audit`        |
| `/ops-validate`   | OpenJarvis | `openjarvis.ops`   |
| `/ship`           | OpenJarvis | `release.ship`     |
| `/retro`          | OpenDev    | `retro.summarize`  |

## Autonomy Levels

| Level          | plan         | implement    | review       | qa           | ship         |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| `full-auto`    | auto         | auto         | auto         | auto         | auto         |
| `approve-ship` | auto         | auto         | auto         | auto         | **approval** |
| `approve-impl` | auto         | **approval** | auto         | auto         | **approval** |
| `manual`       | **approval** | **approval** | **approval** | **approval** | **approval** |

Default: `approve-ship` — safest balance of automation and human oversight.

## Trigger Types

- `manual`: user invokes via Discord command or API
- `error-detection`: runtime error pattern threshold exceeded
- `cs-ticket`: CS channel message classified as bug-report or feature-request
- `scheduled`: cron-based security audit or self-improvement
- `self-improvement`: retro pattern analysis triggers targeted fix sprint

## IDE Usage

Each skill can be invoked directly from the IDE:

- Every SKILL.md in `.github/skills/` defines when to use, process, and output contract
- The "Next Skills" table in each SKILL.md serves as the routing guide
- No complex mode selection or consult patterns required — sprint order is the guide

## Runtime Usage

- `sprintOrchestrator` executes phases sequentially via `actionRunner`
- Each phase uses the existing governance gates, FinOps budgets, and circuit breakers
- Git operations (branch/commit/PR) are handled by `autonomousGit` when `SPRINT_GIT_ENABLED=true`
- Pipeline state persists to Supabase table `sprint_pipelines`

## Safety Guardrails

- Changed file cap per sprint: `SPRINT_CHANGED_FILE_CAP` (default 10)
- Phase timeout: `SPRINT_PHASE_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 120s)
- Total phase execution limit: `SPRINT_MAX_TOTAL_PHASES` (default 12)
- Protected branches (main/master/production) cannot be modified directly
- All code changes go through branch → PR → merge flow

## Boundary Note

Role names (OpenCode, OpenDev, NemoClaw, OpenJarvis) are repository-local collaboration labels.
They do not imply installation of similarly named external OSS frameworks.
Runtime integration exists only where registered actions and configured workers are present.

## Hard Gates

- Do not degrade startup/auth/scheduler reliability.
- Preserve graph-first Obsidian retrieval behavior.
- Sanitize user-facing Discord deliverables, including wrapped deliverable sections.
- Keep workflows and scripts idempotent.
